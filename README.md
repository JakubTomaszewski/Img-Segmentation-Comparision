# SegFormer Semantic Segmentation with Knowledge Distillation

## Overview

This project is being created for my Bachelor's Thesis. 
Its main goal is to create a small and robust Semantic Segmentation model. Eventually, the model will be used for segmenting road scenes in a fully autonomous vehicle. Thus, while preserving good performance the model has to work in real time.


To achive both, a technique known as Knowledge Distillation will be used in order to transfer knowledge from a large and complex model, to a small one.
